Event Ticketing System represents the 3rd-semester project for the Software Technology Engineering programme at VIA University College.
The goal of this project was to create a service for Event Enthusiast, a creative development center, that enables purchasing tickets to a range of live entertainment events easier and faster by establishing a single point of contact between the service provider and the customers. The aim was to develop a system that would aid customerâ€™s existing concerns, primarily by providing a ticketing service for the events that are being hosted by the center.
